# Exploratory-Data-Analysis-on-Amazon-Review
This project performs exploratory data analysis (EDA) on the Amazon product review dataset to uncover trends and insights. Key findings include the distribution of ratings, customer satisfaction patterns, correlations between ratings and feedback, and quality control issues across product categories. Visualizations help identify popular categories, over-rated and under-rated products, and opportunities for businesses to improve customer engagement, product offerings, and quality control strategies.
